Hermione and Harry enter Dumbledore's office with inquisitive faces and open hearts. They see a small portrait of a dog eating a shoe and feel the urge to bow down to it. 

They bend down and kiss the floor beneath the portrait. It suddenly vibrates violently, causing dust to rattle down from the floor. 

Hermione looks at Harry, who can't seem to muster up any words due to the vibrations. She then rolls her eyes.

She looks around the room and spots Voldemort underneath Dumbledore's desk holding his cell phone. Apparently his phone was on vibrate and was so loud that it nearly brought down hogwarts. Harry scrambles over  takes the iPhone from Voldemort and turn off the alarm. 

Harry scolds Voldemort saying, "This is why you don't snooze your alarm your idiot!"
